# SAP-Analytics-Cloud-Story

This project applies enterprise analytics and business intelligence concepts using SAP Analytics Cloud (SAC). It involved completing SAP e-learning modules to build foundational knowledge, followed by the creation of an interactive analytics story using the SAC Retailer Dataset.

Dashboards were created by first modelling the dataset in SAC, then designing multiple story pages focused on sales performance, product trends, customer behaviour, and profitability. Appropriate visualisations such as bar charts, line charts, tables, and geo maps were selected based on the analytical objective of each page. Filters and input controls were added to enable user-driven exploration across time periods, regions, and product categories. Advanced SAC features including Smart Insights and Smart Discovery were used to automatically surface key drivers, patterns, and anomalies.

Each dashboard was supported by written explanations to justify design and analytical decisions, ensuring insights were business-driven rather than purely visual.
