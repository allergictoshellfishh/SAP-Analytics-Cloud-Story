# SAP-Analytics-Cloud-Story

This project applies enterprise analytics and business intelligence concepts using SAP Analytics Cloud (SAC) to analyse sales performance, customer behaviour, product profitability, and cost structures. The objective was to transform a large, multi-dimensional business dataset into actionable insights that support strategic decision-making.

The dataset was prepared and enriched through calculated fields such as delivery duration, cost of goods, profit margin, and average discount. Multiple interactive dashboards were designed around three core themes: Sales & Market Trends, Product & Customer Insights, and Cost & Profitability. A wide range of visualisations—including line charts, treemaps, geo maps, heatmaps, scatter plots, waterfall charts, and KPI summaries—were used to uncover seasonal patterns, regional performance differences, pricing effectiveness, and cost drivers.

Advanced SAC features such as Smart Insights and Smart Discovery were applied to automatically identify key contributors, anomalies, and profit influencers, enabling deeper analysis beyond manual exploration. The final dashboards were business-focused and designed to highlight trade-offs between sales volume, delivery speed, costs, and profit margins.

Overall, this project strengthened my ability to design enterprise dashboards, tell data-driven stories, and translate analytical findings into insights that support real-world business decisions.
